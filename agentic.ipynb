We\\u2019re going to take it a step further, and show how we can dramatically simplify the process, whilst completing more complex tasks.\\\\n\\\\nWe\\u2019ll start by defining the same mock customer/order data as in Anthropic\\u2019s example, plus create a entity relationship between customers and orders:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef _get_orders_customers():\\\\n    orders = {\\\\n        \\\"O1\\\": dict(id=\\\"O1\\\", product=\\\"Widget A\\\", quantity=2, price=19.99, status=\\\"Shipped\\\"),\\\\n        \\\"O2\\\": dict(id=\\\"O2\\\", product=\\\"Gadget B\\\", quantity=1, price=49.99, status=\\\"Processing\\\"),\\\\n        \\\"O3\\\": dict(id=\\\"O3\\\", product=\\\"Gadget B\\\", quantity=2, price=49.99, status=\\\"Shipped\\\")}\\\\n\\\\n    customers = {\\\\n        \\\"C1\\\": dict(name=\\\"John Doe\\\", email=\\\"[[email\\\\xa0protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\\\", phone=\\\"123-456-7890\\\",\\\\n                   orders=[orders[\\\\'O1\\\\'], orders[\\\\'O2\\\\']]),\\\\n        \\\"C2\\\": dict(name=\\\"Jane Smith\\\", email=\\\"[[email\\\\xa0protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\\\", phone=\\\"987-654-3210\\\",\\\\n                   orders=[orders[\\\\'O3\\\\']])\\\\n    }\\\\n    return orders, customers\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\norders, customers = _get_orders_customers()\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nWe can now define the same functions from the original example \\u2013 but note that we don\\u2019t need to manually create the large JSON schema, since Claudette handles all that for us automatically from the functions directly. We\\u2019ll add some extra functionality to update order details when cancelling too.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef get_customer_info(\\\\n    customer_id:str # ID of the customer\\\\n): # Customer\\\\'s name, email, phone number, and list of orders\\\\n    \\\"Retrieves a customer\\\\'s information and their orders based on the customer ID\\\"\\\\n    print(f\\\\'- Retrieving customer {customer_id}\\\\')\\\\n    return customers.get(customer_id, \\\"Customer not found\\\")\\\\n\\\\ndef get_order_details(\\\\n    order_id:str # ID of the order\\\\n): # Order\\\\'s ID, product name, quantity, price, and order status\\\\n    \\\"Retrieves the details of a specific order based on the order ID\\\"\\\\n    print(f\\\\'- Retrieving order {order_id}\\\\')\\\\n    return orders.get(order_id, \\\"Order not found\\\")\\\\n\\\\ndef cancel_order(\\\\n    order_id:str # ID of the order to cancel\\\\n)->bool: # True if the cancellation is successful\\\\n    \\\"Cancels an order based on the provided order ID\\\"\\\\n    print(f\\\\'- Cancelling order {order_id}\\\\')\\\\n    if order_id not in orders: return False\\\\n    orders[order_id][\\\\'status\\\\'] = \\\\'Cancelled\\\\'\\\\n    return True\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\nWe\\u2019re now ready to start our chat.\\\\n\\\\n## Manual tool use\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntools = [get_customer_info, get_order_details, cancel_order]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nchat = Chat(model, tools=tools)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nWe\\u2019ll start with the same request as Anthropic showed:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nr = chat(\\\\'Can you tell me the email address for customer C1?\\\\')\\\\nprint(r.stop_reason)\\\\nr.content\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n- Retrieving customer C1\\\\ntool_use\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[ToolUseBlock(id=\\\\'toolu_01UNkDiQYoKg5QFH1xzP6yNf\\\\', input={\\\\'customer_id\\\\': \\\\'C1\\\\'}, name=\\\\'get_customer_info\\\\', type=\\\\'tool_use\\\\')]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nClaude asks us to use a tool.

    "# Get the puzzle data\n",
    "puzzle = Puzzle(year=2024, day=1)\n",

    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parse the input**: Each line contains two numbers separated by spaces. We split each line and convert the numbers to integers, building two separate lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sort both lists**: We sort each list independently in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pair and calculate differences**: Using `zip()`, we pair up the first element from each sorted list, then the second elements, and so on. For each pair, we calculate the absolute difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sum the differences**: We add up all the differences to get the final answer.\n",

    "- After sorting: `[1,2,3,3,3,4]` and `[3,3,3,4,5,9]`\n",
    "- Differences: `|1-3|=2, |2-3|=1, |3-3|=0, |3-4|=1, |3-5|=2, |4-9|=5`\n",
    "- Sum: `2+1+0+1+2+5 = 11`"
