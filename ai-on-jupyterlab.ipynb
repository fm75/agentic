    "\n",
    "## Usage breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "The landscape has become quite fragmented. Jupyter remains the dominant open-source notebook interface, but usage has spread across several platforms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jupyter/JupyterLab**: Still the standard for local development and research computing\n",
    "- **Google Colab**: Massive user base, especially in education and ML experimentation (free GPU access drives a lot of adoption)\n",
    "- **Kaggle**: Strong in the data science competition/learning community\n",
    "- **VS Code notebooks**: Growing significantly since Microsoft integrated notebook support\n",
    "- **Deepnote, Hex, Observable**: Various commercial alternatives targeting collaboration\n",
    "- **Solveit** (where you are now): Very new - just launched by fast.ai\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard usage numbers are difficult to compare across platforms, but Colab likely has the largest user base due to its accessibility, while JupyterLab remains the standard for serious research/development work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI integration developments\n",
    "\n",
    "The main developments since 2022 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **jupyter-ai** - Official JupyterLab extension (launched 2023) that adds chat interface and magic commands for LLM interaction\n",
    "2. **GitHub Copilot** integration in VS Code notebooks\n",
    "3. **Colab's AI features** - they've added some AI-assisted coding features\n",
    "4. **Various commercial notebook platforms** adding their own AI assistants\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore current usage patterns, I'd suggest:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **jupyter-ai GitHub repo** (jupyter/jupyter-ai) - check issues and discussions to see real usage patterns\n",
    "- JupyterLab extension marketplace to see what AI extensions are popular\n",
    "- Recent JupyterCon talks (2023-2024) about AI integration\n",

    "Based on your experience with solveit and your upcoming return to JupyterLab, here's what you should focus on for practical jupyter-ai integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key things to try first\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The two main interaction modes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[*](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai \"GitHub - jupyterlab/jupyter-ai: A generative AI extension for JupyterLab\") [*](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/v2/ \"Jupyter AI — Jupyter AI documentation\") Jupyter AI offers an `%%ai` magic that turns the notebook into a reproducible generative AI playground, and [*](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai \"GitHub - jupyterlab/jupyter-ai: A generative AI extension for JupyterLab\") [*](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/v2/ \"Jupyter AI — Jupyter AI documentation\") a native chat UI in JupyterLab that enables you to work with generative AI as a conversational assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Installation (JupyterLab 4):**\n",
    "\n",
    "[*](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/index.html \"Users — Jupyter AI documentation\") Install conda and create an environment that uses Python 3.12 and the latest version of JupyterLab, then install with `pip install jupyter-ai[all]` to get all provider dependencies, or selectively install only what you need (e.g., just Anthropic or OpenAI).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Most useful for development workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`%%ai` magic commands in cells** - [*](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai \"GitHub - jupyterlab/jupyter-ai: A generative AI extension for JupyterLab\") [*](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai \"GitHub - jupyterlab/jupyter-ai: A generative AI extension for JupyterLab\") Jupyter AI can interpolate IPython expressions, allowing you to run prompts that include variable values. This is huge for development - you can reference your dataframes, variables, etc. directly in prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chat interface with context** - [*](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/jupyter-ai-coding-in-notebooks/ \"Jupyter AI: AI Coding in Notebooks - DeepLearning.AI\") You can drag existing cells into the chat for debugging, attach files for context, and save chat histories to reuse later as additional context. This fits well with multi-file development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`/learn` and `/ask` commands** - [*](https://blog.jupyter.org/generative-ai-in-jupyter-3f7174824862 \"Generative AI in Jupyter. Jupyter AI, a new open source project… | by Jason Weill | Jupyter Blog\") [*](https://blog.jupyter.org/generative-ai-in-jupyter-3f7174824862 \"Generative AI in Jupyter. Jupyter AI, a new open source project… | by Jason Weill | Jupyter Blog\") You can use the /learn command to teach Jupyternaut about local files, then use /ask to ask questions about them using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Great for working with your own documentation or codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical resources to check\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DeepLearning.AI course** - [*](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/jupyter-ai-coding-in-notebooks/ \"Jupyter AI: AI Coding in Notebooks - DeepLearning.AI\") [*](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/jupyter-ai-coding-in-notebooks/ \"Jupyter AI: AI Coding in Notebooks - DeepLearning.AI\") Build AI applications from scratch, including a book research assistant and a stock data analysis workflow, and learn how to provide API documentation as context. This launched November 2025 so it's current.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GitHub examples directory** - [*](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai \"GitHub - jupyterlab/jupyter-ai: A generative AI extension for JupyterLab\") [*](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai \"GitHub - jupyterlab/jupyter-ai: A generative AI extension for JupyterLab\") The screenshots are from notebooks in the examples/ directory of the jupyter-ai package.

    "\n",
    "Since you mentioned working with Python files, notebooks, CSVs, and markdown simultaneously - the chat interface will be most valuable. You can keep it open in the sidebar while working across files, and the `/learn` command can index your project files so the AI understands your codebase context.\n",
